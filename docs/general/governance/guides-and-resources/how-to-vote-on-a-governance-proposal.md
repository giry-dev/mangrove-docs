# How to vote on a governance proposal

Active proposals active Mangrove DAO Snapshot are first published in the [Governance / Proposals](https://forum.mangrove.exchange/c/governance/proposals/10) category of Mangrove DAO forum. The forum topic includes a link to the Snapshot vote.

1. Head over to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/mangrove.eth)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Locate the proposal you want to vote for (or click the Snapshot link in the forum)
4. Cast your vote by following the prompts within Snapshot

Voters are either Token Holders, Builders, or Pods (or any combination):

* If you hold MGVs on your address, you're part of the Token Holder group. As such, your voting power in this group is equal to the number of your MGVs / total circulating supply of MGVs
* If you hold an active Mangrove Builder NFT, you are part of the Builder group. As such, your Activity Score is used to weigh your influence within this group, based on a quadratic voting formula
* If you hold an active Mangrove Pod NFT, you are part of the Pod group. As of now, all pods have the same weight within their group. As Pods' strategies take off and generate transaction fees on Mangrove, their on-chain economic contribution will be used to define their voting power

When you cast your vote, Snapshot displays your voting power across the 3 categories of stakeholders.
