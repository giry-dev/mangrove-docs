:::info Note
Slippage is the difference between expected and actual trade prices.
* Setting a tolerance allows trades to execute within a certain price range.
* Higher tolerance may mean quicker execution, but less favorable prices.
* Lower tolerance may mean better prices, but potential for trade not to execute.
* Find the right balance for your trade.

5. Click on "Buy" or "Sell" button (depending on your earlier choice). A card will appear, click on "Proceed" then "Approve", and confirm the transaction on your wallet. More information on approval in [this previous section](../approve-buy.md).

7. Confirm the transaction on your wallet.
