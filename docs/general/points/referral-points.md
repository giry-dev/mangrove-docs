# Referral Points
The Referral Program is designed to reward DeFi users who introduce active traders and liquidity providers to Mangrove.

## How does it work?

1. You refer a new participant
2. They trade/provide liquidity on Mangrove
3. Their benefits: they get the equivalent of 10% bonus on their Trading points and LP points as Referral points.
4. Your benefits: you earn 10% of the Trading points and LP points your referee makes each day as Referral points.
*Their referral's points are unaffected by the extra 10% points that you receive.*

## Rules
* No limit on the number of referrals.
* Works on top of the boost system, which means that you receive your referral points after the bonus is allocated, your boost level doesn’t affect your referral points.

## Example

1. Bob refers Alice to Mangrove.
2. Alice earns 50 Trading points and 50 LP points = 100 points.

* Alice's bonus: Receives an extra 10 points (0.1*100) as a referral bonus, totaling 110 points.
* Bob's benefit: Earns 10 points (10% of Alice's original 100 points) for referring Alice.

This referral program rewards both Alice for her activities and Bob for bringing a new participant to Mangrove.
