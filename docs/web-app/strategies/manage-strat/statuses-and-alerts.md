# Statuses and alerts

Your strategy can have one of three statuses: active, inactive, or closed. Depending on the status, alerts may be displayed for your price range or gas.


## Status <font color="#5cd19b">‚óè Active</font>

It means that your strategy is running, profiting from the spread. You may see one of these alert messages while your strategy is active:

* **"About to be out of bounty" button** <br />
Your trategy will soon run out of [bounty](../../../terms/bounty.md) to pay for the taker's compensation in case an [offer fails to execute](../../../kandel/how-does-kandel-work/more-on-failing-offers.md).

* **"About to be out of price range" button**<br />
Your strategy's price range is close to being out of range.

## Status <font color="#eb525a">‚óè Inactive</font> 

It means that your strategy is switched off. There are two reasons why your strategy may be inactive:

* **Out of range**: strategy is out of the price range

* **Insufficient bounty**: strategy's bounty is insufficient

* **Out of range AND insufficient bounty**: combination of the above


## Status <font color="#a7adcd">‚óè Closed</font>

It means that your strategy is shut down.

> What's the difference between an "Inactive" and a "Closed" strategy?<br /><br />
> If your strategy is "Inactive", it means that you have deposited funds and set its parameters, but either it got out of range or there was insufficient bounty.
> If you closed your strategy or withdrew all funds from it, then it is considered as "Closed".
