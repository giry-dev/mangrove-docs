Offers on Mangrove leave of [Offer Lists](market.md). Offers can be taken using market orders or snipped individually. Creating offers requires interacting with an onchain [logic](../../offer-maker/maker-contract.md#offer-logic) (a smart contract) able to [post](../../offer-maker/reactive-offer.md#posting-a-new-offer), [update](../../offer-maker/reactive-offer.md#updating-an-existing-offer) and [execute](../../offer-maker/maker-contract.md) offers.
