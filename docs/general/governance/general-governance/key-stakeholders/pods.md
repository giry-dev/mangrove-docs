# 👩🏽‍💻 Pods

Mangrove protocol is permissionless; anyone can use it to create and run their own _smart offers_ or strategies. In order to incentivize talents to build long-lasting, value-added products on top of Mangrove, the DAO offers a Pod program. Pods have a say in  general governance, and they are entitled to receive a share of the fee their generate on Mangrove markets.

Enabling the most active independent developers and strategists to participate in the governance is a guarantee of neutrality and permissionless nature of the protocol, providing them with a reliable foundation for developing their businesses.

Initially, each pod is given equal voice until their economic contributions can be objectively measured on-chain and there is a sufficient number of active pods. Subsequently, a pod’s voting power will be proportional to its economic contribution to the protocol. The transition to this new model of voting power distribution will be decided by the general governance.

Pods are curated by the Ecosystem Council.
