# Minimum Volume

:::info Important
Due to the [density](../../../../developers/terms/density.md) on each market, there is a minimum token requirement when placing limit orders (except for [IOC orders](../more-on-order-types.md#immediate-or-cancel-ioc)). You can read more about why your transactions might be failing in the [FAQ](../../../FAQ/README.md#why-do-my-transactions-keep-failing). 
:::

This value will change based on the market and the source of liquidity you select, so please check the volume below in the app to make sure before you place your order!
