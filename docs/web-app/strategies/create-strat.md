# Create a strategy


## Step 1/3 - Create strategy

2. Choose a strategy type between "Kandel" and "Kandel on AAVE".
    * [Kandel](../../kandel/README.md) is an automated market-making strategy that utilizes a reserve to place buy and sell orders on Mangrove DEX
    * [Kandel on AAVE](../../kandel/details-on-strats/#kandel-on-aave) is essentially the same as the Kandel strategy, but it also earns extra yield by depositing the reserve on the AAVE platform until the liquidity is needed to fulfill a trade.
    
3. Choose a market and click on "Next."

## Step 2/3 - Strategy parameters
