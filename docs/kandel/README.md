# What is Kandel?

**[Kandel strategy is coming soon]**

Kandel is an Automated Market Making strategy that uses on-chain order flow to repost offers instantly, without any latency. It could be considered as a market-making bot equivalent that operates solely on the blockchain. It leverages **the interaction between buyers and sellers** that creates price movement, rather than the price itself.

Within a market and price range you select, Kandel automatically posts Bids and Asks. **Its main goal is to buy low and sell high** - profits are made through accumulated spread, i.e. the difference between the Bids and Asks that are taken.
