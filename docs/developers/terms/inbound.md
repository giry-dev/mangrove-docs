The token type that an offer taker must send. This token is _inbound_ to the [maker contract](/docs/developers/terms/maker-contract.md) from Mangrove. 

When using [routers](/docs/developers/terms/router.md) from the [Strat Lib](../strat-lib/README.md) the token is then _pushed_ to a location determined by a maker's [reserveId](/docs/developers/terms/reserve-id.md).
