# ðŸ“‹ Overview

Councils within Mangrove DAO are constituted, elected, and funded by the general governance, which also determines their mandatesâ€™ duration and composition.

While these Councils operate autonomously in managing day-to-day operations, they are accountable to the general governance, particularly for proposals exceeding their predefined mandates or for decisions requiring broader strategic alignment.

This structure ensures that the Councils act within the scope and strategy set by the general governance, while also maintaining the flexibility needed for effective operational management.
