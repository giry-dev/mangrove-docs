2. Type in the amount of tokens you want to send or get. The corresponding _send / get_ amount will automatically appear. You can also use the arrow in between the boxes to switch around which token you will _send_ and which you will _get_.

> The green percent value indicates the base token's price change for the last 24h. The price is displayed in quote token. Ex: for the pair WETH/USDC, the price displayed is the value of 1 WETH in USDC.

4. Choose your slippage tolerance.
> ðŸ’¡
> Slippage is the difference between expected and actual trade prices.
> * Setting a tolerance allows trades to execute within a certain price range.
> * Higher tolerance may mean quicker execution, but less favorable prices.
> * Lower tolerance may mean better prices, but potential for trade not to execute.
> * Find the right balance for your trade.
