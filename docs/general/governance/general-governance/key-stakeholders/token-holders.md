# ðŸª™ Token Holders

Token Holders is the largest group participating in the governance of Mangrove DAO. MGV is the Mangrove's governance token, and anyone owning some can either vote or delegate their voting power to someone else. Their participation ensures that a wide range of voices are heard, particularly those with a vested interest in the protocol.

The voting power of a member of this group is directly proportional to the number of tokens held by or delegated to the voting address. The total number of vested MGVs is taken into account, regardless of whether they have been claimed or not.

_NB: The MGV token is currently not transferable and not available on public markets. It is expected that the DAO will start distributing MGVs to Mangrove's users, liquidity providers, market makers, and developers in early 2024._
