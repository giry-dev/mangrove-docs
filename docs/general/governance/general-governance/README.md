# 🏛 Overview

Mangrove DAO’s governance model combines multi-stakeholder general governance with specialized councils, analogous to legislative and executive branches in a parliamentary system.

General governance sets strategic directions and policies,, which encompasses:

* **Strategic Decision-Making**: Overseeing high-level goals and strategies of the DAO.
* **Council Oversight**: Electing, funding, and overseeing council decisions.
* **Operational Oversight**: Evaluating and approving key operational proposals initiated by the councils or the community.
* **Metagovernance**: Updating and refining governance parameters and processes.
