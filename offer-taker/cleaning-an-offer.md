# Cleaning an offer

Offers on Mangrove may fail. This can occur as a consequence of a [deliberate code](../offer-making-strategies/taker-compensation.md) of the Offer Maker (for instance an Offer might defend itself against price slippage) or because of an unexpected event (the Maker Contract may revert). In both cases the Offer Taker is remunerated for her action by receiving a portion of the [Bounty](../offer-maker/offer-bounty.md) attached to the failing Offer.
