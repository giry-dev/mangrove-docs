# What is the Strat Library? ðŸ“–

The Mangrove strat library is a repository of Solidity code that will help you write a custom %%maker contracts|maker-contract%% able to manage offers on the Mangrove.

The strat library provides several good starting points for writing your own custom maker contract for providing liquidity on Mangrove, but the library should be used responsibly.


## Open source and free to use - on your own responsibility

The strat library is open source, and is provided freely to the community as a starting point for writing maker contracts. It is already used as the basis for contracts in the ecosystem. However, do note that the strat library as a whole may still contain bugs, and should be used responsibly and with care (see also [Safety first](#safety-first)).

If you have questions about how to use the Strat library, which are not answered sufficiently in this documentation, do reach out on the Mangrove Discord. And pull requests to the strategy library are, of course, welcome!

## How do I use the Strat Library?

### Choosing the right starting point

Depending on the complexity of the %%offer logic|offer-logic%% your contract implements, you need to choose from which building block you will start to build your %%maker contract|maker-contract%% from. At the very least your logic must provide an implementation of the [`IMaker`](https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove-core/blob/8c2724650c8b0cf3180cbbeb0d4b48d9c1cf9f98/src/MgvLib.sol#L159) interface [required by Mangrove](../contracts/technical-references/taking-and-making-offers/reactive-offer/maker-contract.md), see [technical references](../contracts/technical-references/taking-and-making-offers/reactive-offer/executing-offers.md) for more details.

The first design choice is to decide whether the maker contract you wish to implement will post and update offers on behalf of a privileged user, or whether it will be used by mulitple offer makers in a permissionless fashion. In the first case, you want your contract to inherit [Direct](./explanations/offer-maker/direct.md), in the latter you want to start from a [Forwarder](./explanations/offer-maker/forwarder.md) contract. 

### Customizing the strat using hooks

Default behavior of maker contracts built on top of Mangrove's strat library can be modified by overriding various %%hooks|hook%%, see [how-to's](./how-to-guides/DirectHowTo.md) for some examples.

### Advanced cash management

The strat library also provides a collection of %%router|router%% contracts, which are convenient when the offer logic of your contract involves some interaction with other DeFi bricks (such as a lender).

### Safety first

Writing a maker contract that will post and update offers on Mangrove exposes you to smart contract risks. We recommend reading some important [developer guidelines](./how-to-guides/HowToImplement.md) on the topic to understand better important design principles you should follow.
