# ðŸ“– Proposals

Proposals are formalized and posted by Councils in the [proposals](https://forum.mangrove.exchange/c/governance/proposals/10) category of the Mangrove DAO forum. These proposals may originate from community-submitted ideas discussed in the [temp check](https://forum.mangrove.exchange/c/governance/temp-check/9) category or from the Councils themselves.

The structure of proposals mirrors that of the discussions in section 3.2, with the addition of a unique identifier. Proposals should include:

* **Header**: A unique ID constructed as â€˜MIPâ€™ followed by a chronological number (e.g., MIP1, MIP2), title, authors, date, and type (protocol or ecosystem).
* **Body**: As outlined in section 3.2, including summary, rationale, specification, and optional disclaimer and next steps.

Proposals must be submitted on the forum for comments and deliberation at least 5 days before any voting occurs. This period is crucial for participatory deliberation, allowing proposals to be refined and improved based on community feedback. Authors are required to make all edits visible, either through tracked changes or by adding subsequent posts, ensuring that any modifications to the original proposal are easily identifiable.
