# Taking and making offers

Offers on Mangrove live in [offer lists](offer-list.md). Offers can be taken using [market orders](./taker-order/#market-order) or [sniped](./taker-order/#offer-sniping) individually. Creating offers requires interacting with an on-chain [Maker contract](reactive-offer/maker-contract.md#offer-logic) able to [post](reactive-offer/#posting-a-new-offer), [update](reactive-offer/#updating-an-existing-offer) and [execute](reactive-offer/maker-contract.md) offers.
