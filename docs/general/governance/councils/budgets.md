# ðŸ’° Budgets

Beyond electing members, the general governance also designates a budget for the Councils' term. This budget, crafted by the Ecosystem Council, equips the Councils with resources essential for their roles.

The budget proposal is presented for approval within a month following the election of new Council members, allowing for immediate financial readiness. Additionally, the Ecosystem Council has the option to propose a budget prior to their term's end, ensuring seamless financial continuity for incoming Councils.

Should the budget deplete before the term concludes, the Ecosystem Council may request additional funds from the general governance. Approved budgets are then transferred to the Ecosystem Council's multisig, facilitated by the Guardians.
