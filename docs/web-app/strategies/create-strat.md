1. Click on the "New Strategy" button on the "Your Strategies" tab and accept the Terms and Conditions after reading them.

2. Choose a strategy type between "Kandel" and "Kandel on AAVE".
    * [Kandel](../../kandel/README.md) is an automated market-making strategy that utilizes a reserve to place buy and sell orders on Mangrove DEX
    * [Kandel on AAVE](../../kandel/details-on-strats/#kandel-on-aave) is essentially the same as the Kandel strategy, but it also earns extra yield by depositing the reserve on the AAVE platform until the liquidity is needed to fulfill a trade.
    
3. Choose a market and click on "Next."

## Step 2/3 - Strategy parameters

:::info
* Average return
    * The average monthly return of your Kandel strategy
    * It is calculated by dividing the [profits from the spread](../../../docs/kandel/README.md) by [published liquidity](../../../docs/kandel/how-does-kandel-work/strategy-reserve.md#published-liquidity) for a period of time. It is then averaged out per day for that period, and extrapolated to obtain the monthly average.
    > ðŸ’¡
    > For the sake of this calculation, the published liquidity is converted entirely to USDC.
:::
:::info
* Risk appetite
    * Low: corresponds to a low volatily pair (ex: stable/stable, such as USDC/USDT)
    * Medium: corresponds to a medium volatily pair (ex: volatile/stable, such as WBTC/USDT)
    * High: corresponds to a high volatily pair (ex: volatile/volatile, such as WBTC/WMATIC)

4. Determine your desired price range by dragging the limits on the market depth chart, setting the minimum and maximum price values, or using the percentage inputs. The market depth chart displayed on the strategy page allows you to see the real-time buy (<font color="#5cd19b">Bids</font>) and sell (<font color="#eb525a">Asks</font>) offers on the Mangrove DEX for a given market.
