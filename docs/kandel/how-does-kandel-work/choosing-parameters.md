# Choosing Kandel parameters


This section aims to help you develop an intuition to choose your Kandel parameters. It should be taken as an explanation on how the various parameters can impact your Kandel, and how the market conditions (ex: volatility) could be taken into account. It is **not** a trading advice.

> ðŸ’¡
> As a reminder, Kandel is not intended as a "set and forget" strategy, and needs ongoing maintenance and checks.

We will be going through standard steps you might want a take in order to check the market and deploy a new Kandel. 

## Check-in frequency

First, it is good practice to know how often you aim to update your Kandel. Depending on the trading pair you chose, markets can behave very differently.

Example: I will update my Kandel every 24h.

## Set your price range

Next, you should try to anticipate how much the market/price will vary during that period you just decided on. You are kind of betting on daily volatility.

Example: I will look at the market volatility for the past 24h, and decide on the price range for my new Kandel.

## Ratio: will depend on expected volatility
