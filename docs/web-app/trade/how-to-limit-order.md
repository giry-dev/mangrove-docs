# How to place a limit order


## Types of limit order

There are two types of limit order:

* Good til time: you can set an expiry date for your limit order (ex: I'd like my order to be live for the next 3 days, after which it is canceled)
* [Fill or kill](../../SDK/guides/fill-or-kill.md): in this mode, your limit order would be executed immediately **and** completely, or not at all. The order must be filled in its entirety or else canceled (killed).


## Steps

1. Choose whether to "Buy" or "Sell" and click on the Limit button.
2. Select the token pair you want to trade.
3. Type in the amount of tokens you want to buy/sell. The amount to be sent will automatically appear.
4. Choose a limit average price for your limit order. 
    * For a limit buy order, this is the highest price you are willing to pay for the tokens, and the order will only execute if the market price is at or below your specified limit.
    * For a limit sell order, this is the lowest price you are willing to accept for the tokens, and the order will only execute if the market price is at or above your specified limit.
5. Click on "Approve 'token' for limit orders". A card will appear, click on "Allow 'token'" and confirm the transaction on your wallet.
6. Click on "Buy/Sell 'token'"
7. Verify the information on the confirmation card, click on "Confirm buy/sell" and confirm the transaction on your wallet.
8. Click on "Done".
9. Wait for the notification card to appear, stating that your order has been filled.

Congratulations, you have successfully completed your limit order! ðŸ¤“<br />
