# Sourcing liquidity

## Basic principle

An offer on the Mangrove points to a piece of [solidity](https://solidity-fr.readthedocs.io/fr/latest/) code called a [Maker Contract](maker-contract.md). What this contract is able to deliver is specified as a [Reactive Offer](reactive-offer.md), which is listed in a Mangrove [Offer List](../data-structures/market.md).&#x20;
