# Trading & LP Points

## Trading Points

Takers earn points daily, based on their trading volume within the Mangrove DEX and a specific  weight for each market.

For example, in the WETH/USDB markets, every $1 traded equals 1 point, motivating participants to increase their trading activity.

## Liquidity Provision Points
Liquidity Provision points are awarded to makers on a daily basis, depending on the daily trading points and a predetermined weight for each market.
  
The distribution of points among makers isn't purely proportional to the volume generated by their liquidity.

Maker points depends on:
1. Uptime
2. Proximity of their liquidity to the mid-price
3. Volume generated by their liquidity (taken by takers)
