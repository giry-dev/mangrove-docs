# Offer Lists

## General structure

{% hint style="info" %}
The offer list is the basic Mangrove data structure. It contains offers (created by offer makers) that promise an **outbound token**, and request an **inbound token** in return (offer takers execute these offers by providing the **inbound token**, and receive **outbound tokens** in return).

For example in a DAI-wETH offer list, DAI is the outbound token (i.e. sent or given by the offer) and wETH the inbound token (i.e. received or wanted by the offer).

Relationship to markets: a full market will always feature two offer lists. For instance, a wETH/DAI **market** has one DAI-wETH offer list (where wETH is requested and DAI is offered), and a wETH-DAI offer list (where DAI is requested and wETH is offered).\
\
[Mangrove's API ](../../meta-topics/mangrove-api/)offers Market abstractions that allows liquidity providers and takers to interact with Mangrove using standard **base &** **quote** denominations.
{% endhint %}

Here's a sample DAI-wETH offer list with two offers. Only the main characteristics of the offers are shown (see the [offer data structure](../../data-structures/offer-data-structures.md#mgvlib-offer)).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Decimals**

We display human-readable values here, but Mangrove stores raw token values and never uses the `decimals` field of a token.
{% endhint %}

| Rank | Offer ID | Wants (wETH) | Gives (DAI) | Gas required | Maker Contract | Offer Gas Price |
| ---- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| #1   | 77       | 1            | 2 925.26    | 250,000      | 0x5678def      | 150             |
| #2   | 42       | 0.3          | 871.764     | 300,000      | 0x1234abc      | 200             |

## Offer list fields

### Rank

Offers are ordered from best to worst. Offers are compared based on _price_, and then on _gas required_ (see below) if they have the same price.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**

The price of offer #42 is 0.0003441298 wETH per DAI while the price of offer #77 is 0.00034185 wETH per DAI. Offer #77 is therefore the best offer (lowest price) of this offer list, and is ranked first.
{% endhint %}

### ID

The identifier of the offer in the offer list.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**

Two offers may have the same ID as long as they belong to different offer lists. For instance, there may be an offer #42 on the wETH-DAI offer list with different volumes, gas required, maker contract, etc. than offer #42 in the DAI-wETH offer list shown above.
{% endhint %}

### Wants, gives and Offer price

Taken together, the **wants** and **gives** values define 1) a max volume, 2) a price. The price is p=**wants**/**gives**, and an offer promises delivery of up to **gives** outbound tokens at a price of p tokens delivered per inbound token received.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Examples**

* Offer #42 _wants_ 0.3 wETH to deliver its promised 871.764 DAI.
* If offer #77 is executed and receives 0.5 wETH, it must send back 1462.63 DAI.
{% endhint %}

### Gas required

The maximum amount of gas the [Maker Contract](../../offer-maker/maker-contract.md) managing the offer will be allowed to spend if called by the Mangrove.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**

Offer #77 may consume up to 250K gas units.
{% endhint %}

### Maker Contract

The address of the [Maker Contract](../../offer-maker/maker-contract.md) managing the offer. The `makerExecute` function of this contract will be called when one of its offers is executed.

### Gas Price

Gas price that was used to compute the [offer provision](../../offer-maker/offer-provision.md). If the offer fails to deliver the promised **outbound tokens**, it will be charged in ETH based on this gasprice.

## Offer list configuration

Several [configuration](../../data-structures/mangrove-configuration.md) parameters determine how new offers are inserted. Some are [global](../../data-structures/mangrove-configuration.md#mgvlib.global) to Mangrove, some are [offer list specifics.](../../data-structures/mangrove-configuration.md#mgvlib.local) See [Governance](../../meta-topics/governance.md) section for details.

## View functions

Retrieving the state of an offer list can be easily done by a call to the Mangrove's [Reader Contract](../../meta-topics/mangroves-ecosystem/reader.md) `MgvReader`(see [contract addresses](../../contract-addresses.md)) that returns easy-to-parse[ data structures](../../data-structures/offer-data-structures.md). For gas cautious interactions, when calling from a smart contract, developers may also want to use the reader's `packedOffers` getter, which return packed data that can be parsed using `MgvPack.sol` library.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Views" %}
```solidity
// from MgvReader.sol
// view function to access offer lists off chain.
function offerList(
    address outboundToken, // outbound token of the offer List
    address inboundToken, // inbound token of the offer List
    uint fromId, // retrieve offer list starting from offer id `fromId`
    uint maxOffers // stop after retrieving `maxOffers`
    ) public view returns (
      uint currentId, // last offer Id of the returned offer list
      uint[] memory offerIds, // offer Ids of the list 
      ML.Offer[] memory offerList, // offers
      ML.OfferDetail[] memory offerDetailList // offer details
    );

// view function to access offer list in a packed format (gas cautious).
function packedOfferList(
    address outboundToken,
    address inboundToken,
    uint fromId,
    uint maxOffers
  ) public view returns (
      uint currentId,
      uint[] memory offerIds,
      bytes32[] memory packedOfferList,

    uint gasreq = MgvPack.offerDetail_unpack_gasreq(offerDetailDataList[i]); // how much gas this offer requires
