**General Discussions**

The Mangrove DAO forumâ€™s [general](https://forum.mangrove.exchange/c/governance/general/8) category is a space for open discussions on governance-related topics.

**Discussing Proposals**

For more focused proposal development, participants should use the [temp check](https://forum.mangrove.exchange/c/governance/temp-check/9) category. This section is designed to gauge stakeholder sentiment and foster informal debate around specific ideas that may lead to formal proposals.

Posts in this category should be structured as follows:

* **Header**: Includes the title, authors, and date of the post, and specifies the type as either â€˜protocolâ€™ or â€˜ecosystemâ€™.
* **Body**:
  * **Summary**: A concise overview of the postâ€™s content.
  * **Rationale**: The reasoning behind the idea or question.
  * **Specification**: Detailed description of the proposal or idea.
  * **Disclaimer** (optional): Any necessary legal or contextual disclaimers related to the post.
  * **Next Steps** (optional): Suggested actions or considerations following the discussion.

Anyone can start a Proposal in the temp check category.
