# Deploy Kandel strategy

This tutorial covers how to deploy a Kandel strategy from a developer standpoint. For more information about Kandel, see the [Kandel documentation](../../../general/kandel/README.md).

## Prerequisites

* The tutorial assumes knowledge of JavaScript
* Follow [preparation](./preparation.md) to create a new `tutorial` folder.
* Make sure to use a chain where Mangrove is live - you can find all live addresses for Mangrove [here](../../contracts/technical-references/contract-addresses.md)
* For a more simple tutorial to get acquainted with Mangrove, we recommend [Deploy a simple offer](./basic-offer.md)

### Start local node

Before proceeding, let's import the environment variables made as part of the preparation.

```bash
source .env
```

Start Foundry's local node `anvil` to test things locally, with `$RPC_URL` coming from `.env` and pointing, for instance, to the Polygon Mumbai testnet.

```bash
anvil --fork-url $RPC_URL
```

### Import and connect

Start up `node` in a new terminal and issue the following code which performs the initial setup of loading the `.env` you added in [preparation](./preparation.md), importing the Mangrove SDK, and connecting the SDK to the local node for a specific market.

```javascript reference
https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L1-L23
```

### Generate a minimum distribution

Next, create an instance to manage Kandel strategies (`kandelStrategies`), and load the recommended configuration for the market.

```javascript reference
https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L25-L29
```

With this, you can generate a [distribution](../../../general/kandel/how-does-kandel-work/step-by-step-visual-explanation.md#price-distribution) with the minimum recommended amount of liquidity to avoid [density](/docs/developers/terms/density.md) issues by:

* Creating a generator
* Calculating minimums per offer
* Calculating the distribution for the given price parameters of `minPrice: 900`, `maxPrice: 1100`, and `priceRatio: 1.01`.

See the API documentation for [calculateMinimumDistribution](../technical-references/code/classes/GeometricKandelDistributionGenerator.md#calculateminimumdistribution) for more details on other `distributionParams`. In our example here, `midPrice: 1100` is used to set the [current price](../../../general/kandel/how-does-kandel-work/parameters.md), and decide which offers become bids and which become asks.

```javascript reference
https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L31-L66
```

The last three lines should output something similar to the following (actual volumes may differ due to different configuration for the market):

``` bash
Number of price points: 21
Minimum base volume: 0.0021
Minimum quote volume: 1.9063
```

> ðŸ’¡
> The minimums depend on the price; if the price range is changed, then the minimums should be re-checked.

### Generate desired distribution

Based on the minimum volumes we calculated, we can select a desired distribution with volumes above these values. Here we use `3` for base (WETH) and `3000` for quote (USDC).

```javascript reference
https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L68-L78
```

Note the final log which shows all the bids and asks that will be created, including those that will initially have no liquidity (0 gives) but serve as dual offers of the other side of the book.

### Deploy Kandel instance

Now, you can use the `seeder` to [sow](../technical-references/code/classes/KandelSeeder.md#sow) a Kandel instance for a given seed, and retrieve a `kandelInstance` to manage the deployed instance.

```javascript reference
https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L80-L89
```

A brief explanation on the above `seed` parameters:

* `onAave` indicates whether or not the liquidity to be used by Kandel is sitting on AAVE - here, it is not the case (it will be fetched from a wallet)
* `market`: this is the WETH/USDC pair that we previously chose
* `liquiditySharing` indicates whether you are using shared liquidity or not (SDK only, not available via the UI). This refers to the concept [amplified liquidity](/docs/developers/terms/amplified-liquidity.md).

### Approve transfers

The `kandelInstance` has functions for approving transfers for the base and quote tokens. This is required for the Kandel strategy to be able to transfer tokens from the wallet when depositing funds.

```javascript reference
https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L91-L96
```

#### Mint test tokens

If you are running on a testnet, then you can mint test tokens to send to the Kandel instance.

```javascript reference
 https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L97-L107
```

### Populate offers for the distribution

Now that our Kandel instance is deployed, we can [populate the offers](../../../general/kandel/how-does-kandel-work/step-by-step-visual-explanation.md#populating-bids-and-asks) for the distribution.
This will create offers for the base and quote tokens, and deposit the required amounts of tokens into the Kandel instance.

The offers also need a [provision](/docs/developers/terms/provision.md), hence here the default that we are using can be inspected.

> ðŸ’¡
> The population can span multiple transactions due to gas limits. After this step, the Kandel offers are deployed and are ready to be taken!

```javascript reference
https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L109-L130
```

### Manage existing Kandel instance

Later on, you can also manage an existing Kandel instance. For example, you might want to inspect the status of your offers. For this, the [farm](../technical-references/code/classes/KandelFarm.md) can be used to retrieve Kandel instances you own based on events from the seeder.

```javascript reference
https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L132-L146
```

### Close Kandel strategy and withdraw funds

At some point, you might want to close your Kandel strategy (for instance due to price movements). This can be easily done with the [retractAndWithdraw](../technical-references/code/classes/GeometricKandelInstance.md#retractandwithdraw) function. It will withdraw all funds (both tokens and provision) from the Kandel instance and retract all offers.

```javascript reference
https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.js/blob/2eb3f76f120831a48c577d930fcffc7d55d75c51/examples/tutorials/deploy-kandel.js#L147-L178
```
