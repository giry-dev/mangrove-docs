# ✍ Execution

Councils are responsible for implementing strategies decided by the general governance.

The Protocol Council handles ‘protocol’ type proposals, while the Ecosystem Council manages ‘ecosystem’ proposals. On-chain executable proposals are processed by the relevant Council’s multisig.

Decisions that directly impact the Councils, particularly their member elections and budget allocation, are not managed by the Councils themselves to prevent conflicts of interest. Instead, these operations are executed by [Guardians](../guardians.md).
