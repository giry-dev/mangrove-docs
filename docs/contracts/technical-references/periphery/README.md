# Periphery Contracts

A number of periphery contracts are deployed around the Mangrove core contract to support the core, or to provide convenient or safer methods of interacting with the core contract.

* [Mangrove Reader](reader.md) provides easy to parse views on Mangrove's state.
* [Mangrove Oracle](oracle.md) can act as a gas/density oracle for Mangrove. 
* [Mangrove Cleaner](cleaner.md) is an order reverter contract, which serves to snipe offers for their bounty.
