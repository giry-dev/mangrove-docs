## Deposit/withdraw

This section contains the breakdown of all your deposits and withdrawals.


## Parameters

This sub-tab tracks the parameters changes you made to your Kandel strategy.


## Rebalance

This list includes:
* The empty offers that you refilled
* The funds you moved from your [unallocated inventory](../../../kandel/how-does-kandel-work/strategy-reserve.md#unallocated-liquidity) to your [published inventory](../../../kandel/how-does-kandel-work/strategy-reserve.md#published-liquidity)
