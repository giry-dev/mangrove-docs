The token type that an offer taker will receive. This token is _outbound_ from the %%maker contract|maker-contract%% to Mangrove. 

When using a %%router|router%% from the [Strat Lib](../strat-lib/README.md) the token is _pulled_ from a location determined by maker's %%reserveId|reserve-id%% prior to the transfer to Mangrove.
