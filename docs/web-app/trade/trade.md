# Trade

On Mangrove DEX, there are two types of orders:

* [Market order](./how-to-market-order.md): buy or sell a token at the current market price, executed immediately.

* [Limit order](./how-to-limit-order.md): set a specific buy/sell price for a token, executed only when the market reaches that price.

Prior placing your order, you will be asked to [approve](./approve-buy.md) that Mangrove contracts is allowed to spend the tokens on your behalf.
