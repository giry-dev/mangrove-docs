# Data Structures

Mangrove is using public [offer and order data structures](../../data-structures/offer-data-structures.md) to communicate with [Offer Logics](../../offer-maker/maker-contract.md#offer-logic) during trade and post-hook calls, as well as packaging [protocol configuration variables](../../data-structures/mangrove-configuration.md).&#x20;
