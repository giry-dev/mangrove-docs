# ðŸ—³ Voting

Voting is conducted on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/mangrove.eth). Votes can be initiated either by council members, or by token holders with at least 5% MGVs held/delegated. The following groups each represent one third of the total voting power in general governance:

* **MGV Token Holders**: Their voting weight is proportional to the number of held or vested tokens compared to the total circulating supply of MGVs.
* **Builders Group**: The voting power of Builders is based on an activity score reflecting their period of contribution and full-time engagement. Quadratic voting is applied to balance voting power discrepancies within the group.
* **Pods Group**: Comprising teams of strategists and developers, Pods initially have equal voting influence. Eventually, their voting power will be proportional to the economic value they generate for the protocol.

**Key voting parameters**

* Proposals must be posted in the [proposals](https://forum.mangrove.exchange/c/governance/proposals/10) category of the Mangrove DAO forum at least 5 days before voting on Snapshot.
* The voting duration should be a minimum of 5 days, include one weekend day, and not exceed 7 days.
* A quorum of 5% is required, calculated based on thrice the circulating supply of MGV tokens to equally empower Builders and Pods alongside MGV holders.
* Delegation is available to voters in every group.
