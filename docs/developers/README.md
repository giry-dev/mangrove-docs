# Welcome to the Developer docs

The Mangrove Developers documentation section exists to help developers:

* learn about Mangrove [core protocol](./contracts/README.md),
* understand how trading [strategies](./strat-lib/README.md) can be created and plugged in,
* use and integrate our [SDK](./SDK/README.md),
* set up [Keeper and Cleaning bots](./keeper-bots/README.md).


We suggest you start by reading [this introduction](./contracts/README.md).
If there's anything that is missing, or if you have questions, feel free to reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/rk9Qthz5YE).
