## TL;DR
The Mangrove Season 1 Points Program is designed to reward active participants, known as 'Takers' (traders) and 'Makers' (liquidity providers), in the Mangrove ecosystem. Points are allocated based on specific rules and individual performance in trading and liquidity provision. Participants can also earn points through referrals and community engagement.

* **Trading Points**: Determined by market-specific weightings and calculated based on trade volume. Includes market and limit/amplified orders (in a scenario where LO is partially filled with market order).
* **Liquidity Provision (LP) Points**: Also market-weighted, calculated from uptime, liquidity's proximity to mid-price, and generated volume. Includes limit orders, amplified orders and strategies.
* **Boosts**: A tiered level system increasing LP and trading points, determined by trading volume and volume generated.
* **Referral Points**: Gives a 10% bonus in points for both referee and referrer, based on the referee's LP and trading points.
* **Community Points**: Gives points to past and future active participants in ADDMA-organised campaigns.
