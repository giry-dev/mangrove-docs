A maker contract's **hook** is an internal function that can be overridden to change the default behavior of an offer logic. 
We list [here](../strat-lib/technical-references/main-hooks.md) the main available hooks.

[Routers](../strat-lib/technical-references/router.md) also use hooks to specialize liquidity management functions.
