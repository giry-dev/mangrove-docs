# Creating & Updating offers

### Posting a new offer

New offers should mostly be posted by [contracts](maker-contract.mdx) able to source liquidity when asked by Mangrove.&#x20;

:::info 

`newOffer` is payable and can be used to credit the Offer Logic's balance on Mangrove on the fly. A non zero `msg.value` will allow Mangrove to credit Offer Logic's balance prior to locking the [provision](offer-provision.mdx) of the newly posted offer.

**Inputs**

* `outbound_tkn` address of the outbound token (that the offer will provide).
* `inbound_tkn` address of the inbound token (that the offer will receive).
* `wants` amount of inbound tokens requested by the offer. **Must** fit in a `uint96`.
* `gives` amount of outbound \*\*\*\* tokens promised by the offer. **Must** fit in a `uint96` and be strictly positive. **Must** provide enough volume w.r.t to `gasreq` and offer list's %%density|density%% parameter.
* `gasreq` amount of gas that will be given to the offer's [account](maker-contract.mdx). **Must** fit in a `uint24` and be lower than gasmax. Should be sufficient to cover all calls to the offer logic posting the offer ([`makerExecute`](maker-contract.mdx#offer-execution) and [`makerPosthook`](maker-contract.mdx#offer-post-hook)). **Must** be compatible with the offered volume `gives` and the offer list's %%density|density%% parameter.
* `gasprice` gas price override used to compute the order provision (see [offer bounties](offer-provision.mdx)). Any value lower than Mangrove's current %%gasprice|gasprice%% will be ignored (thus 0 means "use Mangrove's current %%gasprice|gasprice%% "). **Must** fit in a `uint16`.
* `pivotId` where to start the insertion process in the offer list. If `pivotId` is not in the offer list at the time the transaction is processed, the new offer will be inserted starting from the offer list's [best](./#getting-current-best-offer-of-a-market) offer. Should be the id of the existing live offer with the price closest to the price of the offer being posted.

**Outputs**

* `offerId` the id of the newly created offer. Note that offer ids are scoped to [offer lists](../market.md), so many offers can share the same id.

:::danger **Provisioning**

Since offers can fail, Mangrove requires each offer to be [provisioned](offer-provision.mdx) in ETH. If an offer fails, part of that provision will be sent to the caller that executed the offer, as compensation.

Make sure that your offer is [well-provisioned](offer-provision.mdx#checking-an-account-balance) before calling `newOffer`, otherwise the call will fail. The easiest way to go is to send a comfortable amount of ETH to Mangrove from your offer-posting contract. Mangrove will remember your ETH balance and use it when necessary.

:::

:::danger **Offer execution**

* If the offer account is a contract, it should implement the [IMaker](maker-contract.mdx) interface. At the very least, it must have a function with signature [`makerExecute(MgvLib.SingleOrder calldata order)`](maker-contract.mdx#offer-execution) or it will systematically revert when called by Mangrove.
* `gives` and `gasreq` are subject to [density](../../governance-parameters/local-variables.md#density) constraints on the amount of _outbound_ token provided per gas spent.
* The offer account will need to give Mangrove a high enough allowance in _outbound_ tokens since Mangrove will use the ERC20 standard's `transferFrom` function to source your tokens.

:::

### Updating an existing offer

Offers are updated through the aptly-named `updateOffer` function described below (source code is [here](https://github.com/giry-dev/mangrove/blob/552ab35500c34e831f40a68fac81c8b3e6be7f5b/packages/mangrove-solidity/contracts/MgvOfferMaking.sol#L99)).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Inputs

* `offerId` is the offer id of the offer to be updated.
* For the other parameters, see [above](./#posting-a-new-reactive-offer).

#### Outputs

None.

:::info **Offer updater**

An offer can only be updated if `msg.sender` is the [account](maker-contract.mdx) that created the offer.

:::

:::caution **Reusing offers**

After being executed or [retracted](./#retracting-an-offer), an offer is moved out of the offer list. It can still be updated and reinserted in the offer list. We recommend updating offers instead of creating new ones, as it costs much less gas.
:::

### Retracting an offer

An offer can be withdrawn from the order book via the `retractOffer` function described below.

<TabItem value="signature" label="Signature" default>

```solidity
function retractOffer(
    address outboundToken,
    address inboundToken,
    uint offerId,
    bool deprovision
  ) external;

```solidity

event OfferRetract(
    address outboundToken, // address of the outbound token ERC of the offer
    address inboundToken, // address of the inbound token ERC of the offer

    );

// emitted if offer is deprovisioned
event Credit(
    address maker, // account being credited
    uint amount // amount (in wei) being credited to the account
); 
```

<TabItem value="revertStrings" label="Revert strings">

<TabItem value="solidity" label="Solidity">

```solidity
import "./Mangrove.sol";

// context of the call

function myRetractOffer(uint offerId) external {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Invalid caller");
        // calling mangrove with offerId as pivot (assuming price update will not change much the position of the offer)
        Mangrove(MGV).retractOffer(
                outTkn, // reposting on the same market
                inbTkn, 
                offerId, // id of the offer to be updated
                false // do not deprovision offer, saves gas if one wishes to repost the offer later
        );
}
...
...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Inputs

* `offerId` is the offer id of the offer to be updated.
* `deprovision` if true, will free the offer's ETH provision so that you can [withdraw](offer-provision.mdx#withdrawing) them. Otherwise, will leave the provision in the offer.
* For the other parameters, see [above](./#posting-a-new-reactive-offer).

#### Outputs

None.
