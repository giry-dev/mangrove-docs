## Open source on GitHub

The Solidity source code for the Mangrove protocol is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove-core).

## Literate source code

The Mangrove protocol is commented in the tradition of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) where natural language and code is intervowen. Thus, the protocol code itself actually constitutes a very readable and comprehensive technical documentation.

A nicely formatted, single webpage representation of the literate source code can be found [here](pathname:///MgvDoc/).
