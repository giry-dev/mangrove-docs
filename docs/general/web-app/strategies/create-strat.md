2. Select a market and click on "Next."

3. Choose a strategy type between "Kandel" and "Kandel on AAVE".
    * [Kandel](../../kandel/README.md) is an automated market-making strategy that utilizes a reserve to place buy and sell orders on Mangrove DEX
    * [Kandel on AAVE](../../kandel/kandel-aave/kandel-aave.md) is essentially the same as the Kandel strategy, but it also earns extra yield by depositing the reserve on the AAVE platform until the liquidity is needed to fulfill a trade.

## Strategy parameters

:::info note
Average return: the average monthly return of kandels for this market.

* Medium: corresponds to a medium volatily pair (ex: volatile/stable, such as WBTC/USDT)
* High: corresponds to a high volatily pair (ex: volatile/volatile, such as WBTC/WMATIC)
