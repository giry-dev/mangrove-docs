# How to delegate my voting power

If you don't have the time or resources to actively participate in Mangrove DAO's governance, you can still make your voice heard by delegating your voting power to anyone.

In order to do that, head over to Mangrove DAO Snapshot space, connect your wallet, and select the _Delegate_ link in the sidebar, under _Proposals_:

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Snapshot's UI let you set the Ethereum address or ENS name you'll be delegating your voting power to:

When you delegate, all your voting power goes to the target address, regardless of its source: MGVs held or claimable, activity score as a Builder or as a Pod. You can undelegate or select another delegate at any time (but Snapshot takes into account the state of your delegation at the time of the start of voting period).
