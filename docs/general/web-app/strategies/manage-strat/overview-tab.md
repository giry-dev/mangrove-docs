## Information cards

<!-- * **Return**: the average monthly return of your Kandel strategy (or in other word, the growth rate of your wealth). It is calculated by dividing the [profits from the spread](../../../kandel/README.md) and the impermanent loss by the [published liquidity](../../../kandel/how-does-kandel-work/strategy-reserve.md#published-liquidity) for a period of time. It is then averaged out per day for that period, and extrapolated to obtain the monthly average.
    * Return = (profit from spread + impermanent loss) / published liquidity
> ðŸ’¡
> For the sake of this calculation, the published liquidity is converted entirely to USDC. -->

* **Unrealized PnL**: potential profit or loss. It is calculated by comparing the your entry value of your inventory to the current value of your inventory. The difference between these two values determines the size and direction of your unrealized gain or loss.

* **Total base/quote inventory**: amount of base tokens and quote tokens that are published in active offers.
