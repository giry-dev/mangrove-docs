# Referral Points

Encouraging ecosystem growth and a tight community, the Referral Program rewards users who introduce active traders and liquidity providers to Mangrove. Both referrer and referee receive a 10% bonus on trading and LP points.

## How does it work?

1. Access the referral page on [Mangrove dApp](https://app.mangrove.exchange/referrals)
2. Select “Create a referral link” and sign the transaction on your wallet
3. Share your link on social media and with your friends
   - For each maker & trader point they generate they get 10% extra as Referral points.
   - You earn 10% of their boosted maker and taker points as Referral points. Their points are unaffected by the extra 10% points that you receive.

🥳There is no limit on the number of referrals. The more friends join the party, the more points for you!

🎈You receive your referral points based on the boosted amounts of points earned by the referee. However your own boost level doesn’t affect your referral points.

### Example

1. Bob refers Alice to Mangrove.
2. Alice earns 100 points from her market volume.
3. Alice has her boost applied, giving her an end total of 250 points

- Alice's bonus: Receives an extra 25 points (0.1 \* 250) as a referral bonus, totaling 275 points.
- Bob's benefit: Earns 25 points (10% of Alice's boosted 250 points) for referring Alice.

This referral program rewards both Alice for her activities and Bob for bringing a new participant to Mangrove.
