A bounty is an amount of native token paid to the taker when an offer fails.

Bounties serve two purposes:
1. It compensates the taker for the gas spent on making the offer fail
2. It incentivizes cleaning of the order books by sniping offers that will fail.

Bounties are paid by the owner of the offer and are taken from the provisions they deposited with Mangrove when posting the offer.
