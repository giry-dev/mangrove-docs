# How does Kandel work?

This section is a detailed explanation of how Kandel works, introducing configuration parameters and key mechanics. For the sake of simplicity, we have clearly separated the startup steps and picked round numbers.

For a detailed explanation on how to create and manage a Kandel strategy on Mangrove's UI, you can view the [Create a strategy](../../web-app/strategies/create-strat.md) and [Manage a strategy](../../web-app/strategies/manage-strat/statuses-and-alerts.md) pages on our Web App documentation.
