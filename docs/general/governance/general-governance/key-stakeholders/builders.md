The focus of Builders is on ensuring the ecosystem thrives sustainably over the long term. Builders bring a deep understanding of the protocolâ€™s needs and a commitment to its ongoing development and growth.

The voting power of Builders is based on an activity score that reflects their period of contribution and intensity of collaboration (full-time or part-time). Quadratic voting is applied to balance voting power discrepancies within the group.

The distribution of voting power within this group is self-determined and may evolve over time without external validation.
