# ðŸ›¡ Guardians

Mangrove DAO Guardians play a crucial role in upholding the integrity and execution of the DAO's governance model. Independent from the Mangrove core team and Councils, Guardians are responsible for implementing specific DAO decisions, notably those concerning Councils' elections and budget allocations.

#### Role and Responsibilities

Guardians are responsible for implementing specific DAO decisions, notably those concerning Councils' elections and budget allocations. This arrangement ensures that Councils cannot self-elect or assign budgets independently, safeguarding the DAO's democratic governance principles.

#### Selection and Composition

Guardians are highly respected individuals within the community, known for their integrity and reputation. Their selection, initially facilitated by the Mangrove Association, emphasizes independence and trustworthiness. Each Guardian acts as a signer on a 5/9 multisig Safe, dedicated solely to executing Mangrove DAO decisions.

#### Operation and Governance

The multisig Safe operated by the Guardians is utilized exclusively for actions authorized by the DAO's governance processes, and tagged as such in associated proposals. This mechanism ensures transparency and accountability in executing critical decisions, reinforcing the Guardians' role as impartial executors.
