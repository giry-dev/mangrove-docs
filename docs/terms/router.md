# Router

Routers are smart contracts that are used by offer logics to manage liquidity in a modular fashion. Routers interact with maker contracts via the [AbstractRouter](https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove-core/blob/382d55788ca1667312f8046e198fc3235ff93650/src/strategies/routers/AbstractRouter.sol#L24) interface.

For more details, see e.g., [MangroveOffer](../strat-lib/explanations/offer-maker/mangrove-offer.md) or `AbstractRouter` in [Strat-lib API documentation](../strat-lib/technical-references/APIReference.md).
