# Trivial offer

{% hint style="info" %}
A **Trivial Offer** is a [reactive Offer](../offer-maker/reactive-offer.md#posting-a-new-offer) listed on Mangrove that is not equipped with any on-chain [logic](../offer-maker/#executing-offers). Whenever it is matched by a [taker order](../offer-taker/#taking-offers), the offer sources its liquidity on an Externally Owned Account (EOA).
