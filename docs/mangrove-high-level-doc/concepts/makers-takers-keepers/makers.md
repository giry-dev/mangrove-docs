# Makers

They create and own the offers on Mangrove. For example, they promise to give a Taker some apples 🍎 if he gives them oranges 🍊 in return. That is why Mangrove is beautiful: Makers can plant their apples in their garden, or someone else's, until a Taker that wants some apples picks their offer.

We are explaining Makers in more detail in the [Developer section](../../../contracts/technical-references/overview.md) (relax, it's still very much understandable).
