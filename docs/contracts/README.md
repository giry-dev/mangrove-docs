# Contracts

The Mangrove is an on-chain, orderbook-based exchange where offers are code. Mangrove is built with Solidity with [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/) that run on [EVM-compatible](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/#evm-compatibility) blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon.

In this part of the site you will find

* a number of [Tutorials](./tutorials/tutorials.md) and [Guides](./how-to-guides/how-to-guides.md) for developing smart contracts that work with Mangrove
* [Technical reference](./technical-references/technical-references.md) material, including 
    * an [Overview of the smart contracts](./technical-references/overview.md) comprising Mangrove
    *  **TODO**: the [code docs](./technical-references/api-docs.md) generated from the [NatSpec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/natspec-format.html) for Mangrove
    * a reference page for the [Deployment addresses](./technical-references/contract-addresses.md)
