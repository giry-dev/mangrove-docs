## Step 1/3 - Create a strategy

**[Screenshots coming soon]**

1. Click on the "New Strategy" button on the "Your Strategies" tab and accept the Terms and Conditions after reading them.

2. Choose a strategy type between "Kandel" and "Kandel on AAVE".
    * [Kandel](../../kandel/README.md) is an automated market-making strategy that utilizes a reserve to place buy and sell orders on Mangrove DEX
    * [Kandel on AAVE](../../kandel/details-on-strats/#kandel-on-aave) is essentially the same as the Kandel strategy, but it also earns extra yield by depositing the reserve on the AAVE platform until the liquidity is needed to fulfill a trade.
    
3. Choose a market and click on "Next."

> ðŸ’¡
> Markets are sorted in three "risk appetite" categories (Low, Medium, High).<br />For more details, hover over the tooltip ðŸ›ˆ in the UI.

## Step 2/3 - Choose parameters

4. Determine your desired price range by dragging the limits on the market depth chart, setting the minimum and maximum price values, or using the percentage inputs. The market depth chart displayed on the strategy page allows you to see the real-time buy (Bids) and sell (Asks) offers on the Mangrove DEX for a given market.

5. Choose your initial inventory for both tokens.

6. Choose a bounty amount.

7. Click on "Review Strategy".


## Step 3/3 - Review strategy

**[Screenshots coming soon]**

8. Check your strategy parameters carefully. If you want to edit them, click on "Back." If you agree with them, click on "Launch strategy".

9. Wait for confirmation and then choose between clicking on 'View strategy' to manage your strategy or selecting 'Done' to go back to the Strategies page.
