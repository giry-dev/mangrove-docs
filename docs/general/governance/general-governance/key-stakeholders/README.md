# ðŸ§© Key Stakeholders

Distributing influence among stakeholders is done by defining groups or classes of voters that have a set share of the overall voting power, regardless of the number of members in each group.

This ensures that the main interest groups are always represented in strategic decisions. Neither the turnover within each group nor the transfer of tokens can alter this balance.

At Mangrove, one third of the voting power to each of the three main groups of stakeholders: [Token Holders](token-holders.md), [Builders](builders.md), and [Pods](pods.md):

Each group has a third of the voting power. This is not an initial distribution scheme, but a permanent allocation of power to each class of stakeholders.

Votes are counted as the aggregated percentage of voting of each group.

_NB: Individuals or entities may hold memberships in more than one group. They have the option to consolidate these memberships under a single address for voting or maintain separate addresses to vote independently within each group._
