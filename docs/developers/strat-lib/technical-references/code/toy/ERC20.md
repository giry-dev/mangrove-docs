## ERC20Base

_Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
to implement supply mechanisms].

We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
applications.

Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
allowances. See {IERC20-approve}._

### _balances

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) _balances
```

### _allowances

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) _allowances
```

### _totalSupply

```solidity
uint256 _totalSupply
```

### _name

```solidity
string _name
```

### _symbol

```solidity
string _symbol
```

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(string name_, string symbol_) public
```

_Sets the values for {name} and {symbol}.

The default value of {decimals} is 18. To select a different value for
{decimals} you should overload it.

All two of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during
construction._

### name

```solidity
function name() public view virtual returns (string)
```

_Returns the name of the token._

### symbol

```solidity
function symbol() public view virtual returns (string)
```

_Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name._

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() public view virtual returns (uint8)
```

_Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is
overridden;

NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
{IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}._

### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-totalSupply}._

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-balanceOf}._

### transfer

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transfer}.

Requirements:

- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- the caller must have a balance of at least `amount`._

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-allowance}._

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-approve}.

NOTE: If `amount` is the maximum `uint256`, the allowance is not updated on
`transferFrom`. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address._

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transferFrom}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not
required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}.

NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance
is the maximum `uint256`.

Requirements:

- `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`.
- the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least
`amount`._

### increaseAllowance

```solidity
function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_Atomically increases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.

This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for
problems described in {IERC20-approve}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address._

### decreaseAllowance

```solidity
function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.

This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for
problems described in {IERC20-approve}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address.
- `spender` must have allowance for the caller of at least
`subtractedValue`._

### _transfer

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Moves `amount` of tokens from `from` to `to`.

This internal function is equivalent to {transfer}, and can be used to
e.g. implement automatic token fees, slashing mechanisms, etc.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`._

### _mint

```solidity
function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Creates `amount` tokens and assigns them to `account`, increasing
the total supply.

Emits a {Transfer} event with `from` set to the zero address.

Requirements:

- `account` cannot be the zero address._

### _burn

```solidity
function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Destroys `amount` tokens from `account`, reducing the
total supply.

Emits a {Transfer} event with `to` set to the zero address.

Requirements:

- `account` cannot be the zero address.
- `account` must have at least `amount` tokens._

### _approve

```solidity
function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the `owner` s tokens.

This internal function is equivalent to `approve`, and can be used to
e.g. set automatic allowances for certain subsystems, etc.

Emits an {Approval} event.

Requirements:

- `owner` cannot be the zero address.
- `spender` cannot be the zero address._

### _spendAllowance

```solidity
function _spendAllowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Updates `owner` s allowance for `spender` based on spent `amount`.

Does not update the allowance amount in case of infinite allowance.
Revert if not enough allowance is available.

Might emit an {Approval} event._

### _beforeTokenTransfer

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens. This includes
minting and burning.

Calling conditions:

- when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
will be transferred to `to`.
- when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.

function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Hook that is called after any transfer of tokens. This includes
minting and burning.

- when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
has been transferred to `to`.
- when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens have been minted for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens have been burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.

## ERC20

_Implementation of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].

Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on `{IERC20-approve}`, the token holder account doesn't
need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.

_Available since v3.4.__

### _nonces

```solidity
mapping(address => struct Counters.Counter) _nonces
```

### _PERMIT_TYPEHASH

```solidity
bytes32 _PERMIT_TYPEHASH
```

### _PERMIT_TYPEHASH_DEPRECATED_SLOT

```solidity
bytes32 _PERMIT_TYPEHASH_DEPRECATED_SLOT
```

_In previous versions `_PERMIT_TYPEHASH` was declared as `immutable`.
However, to ensure consistency with the upgradeable transpiler, we will continue
to reserve a slot._

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(string name) internal
```

_Initializes the {EIP712} domain separator using the `name` parameter, and setting `version` to `"1"`.

It's a good idea to use the same `name` that is defined as the ERC20 token name._

### permit

```solidity
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public virtual
```

_See {IERC20Permit-permit}._

### nonces

```solidity
function nonces(address owner) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20Permit-nonces}._

### DOMAIN_SEPARATOR

```solidity
function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() external view returns (bytes32)
```

_See {IERC20Permit-DOMAIN_SEPARATOR}._

### _useNonce

```solidity
function _useNonce(address owner) internal virtual returns (uint256 current)
```

_"Consume a nonce": return the current value and increment.

_Available since v4.1.__
