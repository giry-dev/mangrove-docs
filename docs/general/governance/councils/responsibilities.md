# ✔ Responsibilities

Mangrove DAO establishes two councils to address distinct areas requiring specialized skills:

* **Protocol Council**: Responsible for maintaining the Mangrove protocol, overseeing research, technical product management, devops, security operations, and the technical enforcement of governance decisions. It manages both on-chain and off-chain components, including extensions such as SDKs.
* **Ecosystem Council**: Takes on the economic and social aspects of Mangrove. Its responsibilities include the curation of public strategies, strategic roadmap development and management, attracting and supporting Pods, managing resources, implementing incentive programs, forming partnerships, and overseeing the DAO’s treasury.

The Councils focus on strategic oversight rather than direct task execution. They determine what needs to be accomplished within their areas of responsibility, delegate these tasks to suitable service providers, and monitor to ensure that all activities are completed timely, within budget, and according to specified standards.

Councils' responsibilities also include managing budgets, responding to community inputs, and preparing governance proposals as necessary.
