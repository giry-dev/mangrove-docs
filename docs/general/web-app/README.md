# Who is the Mangrove DEX for?

The Mangrove DEX offers a range of functionalities including market orders, limit orders, and the ability to deploy strategies, catering to different levels of DeFi users from beginners to experienced.
<br />

While [market orders](./trade/how-to-make-an-order/market-order.md) are accessible to all types of users, [limit orders](./trade/how-to-make-an-order/limit-order.md) and [amplified orders](./trade/how-to-make-an-order/amplify-order.md) may be a bit more complex, and strategies (coming soon:tm:) are more suitable for experienced DeFi users.
