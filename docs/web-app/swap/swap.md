## Steps to perform a swap

1. Select a token pair for your swap. Feel free to pick one in the list, or use the search bar.

2. Type in the amount of tokens you want to send or get. The corresponding _send / get_ amount will automatically appear. You can also use the arrow in between the boxes to switch around which token you will _send_ and which you will _get_.
> ðŸ’¡
> The green percent value indicates the base token's price change for the last 24h. The price is displayed in quote token. Ex: for the pair WETH/USDC, the price displayed is the value of 1 WETH in USDC.

4. Choose your slippage tolerance.
> ðŸ’¡
> Slippage is the difference between expected and actual trade prices.
> * Setting a tolerance allows trades to execute within a certain price range.
> * Higher tolerance may mean quicker execution, but less favorable prices.
> * Lower tolerance may mean better prices, but potential for trade not to execute.
> * Find the right balance for your trade.

6. Click "Done" to close the pop-up.
