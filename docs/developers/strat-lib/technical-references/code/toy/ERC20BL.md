## ERC20BL

### _blacklisted

```solidity
mapping(address => bool) _blacklisted
```

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(string _name, string _symbol) internal
```

### notBlackListed

```solidity
modifier notBlackListed(address addr)
```

### _blacklists

```solidity
function _blacklists(address addr) internal virtual
```

### _whitelists

```solidity
function _whitelists(address addr) internal virtual
```

### transfer

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transfer}.

Requirements:

- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- the caller must have a balance of at least `amount`._

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-approve}.

NOTE: If `amount` is the maximum `uint256`, the allowance is not updated on
`transferFrom`. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address._

### permit

```solidity
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public virtual
```

_See {IERC20Permit-permit}._

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transferFrom}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not
required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}.

NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance
is the maximum `uint256`.

Requirements:

- `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`.
- the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least
`amount`._
