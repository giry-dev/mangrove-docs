# What is Mangrove? ðŸŒ´

The Mangrove is an [EVM-compatible](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/#evm-compatibility) order book-based exchange protocol (a [DEX](https://ethereum.org/en/defi/)), in which offers can be bound to a [smart contract](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/).

The order book of Mangrove lists promises to trade, instead of locked commitments.

* Offer makers add [liquidity promises](explanations/offer-maker/README.md) to Mangrove. They own offers in [offer lists](te/takin/../../technical-references/taking-and-making-offers/market.md) and manage contracts that react to [offer execution](technical-references/taking-and-making-offers/reactive-offer/offer-data-structures.md).
* Takers go to Mangrove to [find liquidity](explanations/offer-taker.md) by executing offers already in Mangrove.
* [Governance](technical-references/governance-parameters/README.md) adjusts Mangrove parameters, opens new pairs, sets fees, etc.
