# Offer Logic
The offer logic is the part of the maker contract that executes as a consequence of a call by Mangrove. The offer logic is split into [trade execution](../contracts/technical-references/taking-and-making-offers/reactive-offer/maker-contract.mdx#trade-execution)
and [trade posthook](../contracts/technical-references/taking-and-making-offers/reactive-offer/maker-contract.mdx#trade-posthook).
