# Periphery Contracts

Two periphery contracts are deployed around the Mangrove core contract to support the core, or to provide convenient methods for interacting with the core contract.

* [MgvReader](reader.md) provides easy to parse views on Mangrove's state.
* [MgvOracle](oracle.md) can act as a gas/density oracle for Mangrove.
