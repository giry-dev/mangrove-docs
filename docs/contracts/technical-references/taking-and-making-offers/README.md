# Taking and making offers

Offers on Mangrove live of [Offer Lists](offer-list.md). Offers can be taken using market orders or snipped individually. Creating offers requires interacting with an onchain [maker contract](reactive-offer/maker-contract.md#offer-logic) (a smart contract) able to [post](reactive-offer/#posting-a-new-offer), [update](reactive-offer/#updating-an-existing-offer) and [execute](reactive-offer/maker-contract.md) offers.
