The token type that an offer taker will receive. This token is _outbound_ from the [maker contract](/docs/developers/terms/maker-contract.md) to Mangrove. 

When using a [router](/docs/developers/terms/router.md) from the [Strat Lib](../strat-lib/README.md) the token is _pulled_ from a location determined by maker's [reserveId](/docs/developers/terms/reserve-id.md) prior to the transfer to Mangrove.
