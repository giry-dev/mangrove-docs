# Community Points

The ADDMA, a French association contributing to the MangroveDAO, may launch campaigns during the MS1 Points Program to reward past or current active traders. These campaigns are designed to assist in the growth of Mangrove and can provide participants with benefits.

## Testnet & Beta Mainnet Participants Benefits
To facilitate the testing of Mangrove Exchange, the Mangrove Testnet was launched in March 2023 on the Polygon testnet. Following this, the Mangrove Beta Mainnet began in July 2023 on the Polygon Mainnet.

### Testnet NFT Holders Benefits

During the testnet, participants were able to claim 3 different NFTs on Galxe. Depending on the highest NFT, these participantsâ€™ wallet addresses will have access to a specific Boost Level for a period of 4 weeks and a points allocation, to reward their early contribution to the protocol.

* [Mangrove Seed](https://opensea.io/collection/mangrove-seed-nft): 5,000 Community points (equivalent to $5,000 volume traded)
* [Mangrove Tree](https://opensea.io/collection/mangrove-tree-nft): Level 1 (x1.75 boost) and 10,000 Community points (equivalent to $20,000 volume traded)
* [Mangrove Forest](https://opensea.io/collection/mangrove-forest-nft): Level 2 (x2.5 boost) and 60,000 Community points (equivalent to $60,000 volume traded)

:::warning
WARNING: We do not encourage to buy a NFT on the secondary market, because we have to take a snapshot on the Blast Mainnet Day. If you buy afterwards, you are not eligible for any bonus or rewards.

### Beta Mainnet Participants Benefits
Wallet addresses that participated in the Beta Mainnet are rewarded with a special Boost Level for a period of 4 weeks and a points allocation based on their trading volume. This includes:
* Level 3 (x3 boost)
* Community points depending on volume generated and volume traded, to be distributed later.
