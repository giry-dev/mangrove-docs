---

The _provision_ of an offer is an amount of native tokens that is attached to the offer on Mangrove. A subset of it, called the [bounty](./bounty.md), is used to compensate the taker on a failure to deliver the promised liquidity by the maker. The provision can be redeemed by the [offer owner](/docs/developers/terms/offer-owner.md) when the offer is no longer live.
