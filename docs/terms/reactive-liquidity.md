Also known as %%Amplified liquidity|amplified-liquidity%%.

Liquidity providers can post offers that are not fully provisioned. It is enough that their code brings the promised liquidity at match-time. In the meantime, it can be put to work. If using the [Strat Lib](../strat-lib/README.md), advanced %%routers|router%% can be used to push and pull liquidity from %%reserves|reserve%%.
