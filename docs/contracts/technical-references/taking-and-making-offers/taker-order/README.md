# Taking offers

## Generalities

### Token allowance

ERC20 tokens transfers are initiated by Mangrove using `transferFrom`. If Mangrove's `allowance` on the taker's address (for tokens to be spent) is too low, the order will revert.

### Active offer lists

Every Mangrove[ offer list ](../offer-list.md#general-structure)can be either [active or inactive](../../governance-parameters/local-variables.md#de-activating-an-offer-list), and Mangrove itself can be either [alive or dead](../../governance-parameters/global-variables.md#other-governance-controlled-setters). Taking offers is only possible when Mangrove is alive on offer lists that are active.

## Market order

A **Market Order** is Mangrove's simplest way of buying or selling assets. Such (taker) orders are run against a specific [offer list](../offer-list.md#general-structure) with its associated _outbound_ token (tokens that flow out of Mangrove) and _inbound_ token (tokens that flow into Mangrove). The liquidity taker specifies how many _outbound_ tokens she [wants](../offer-list.md#wants-gives-and-entailed-price) and how many _inbound_ tokens she [gives](../offer-list.md#wants-gives-and-entailed-price).


:::info **Mangrove Market Order = TradFi Limit Order**

Mangrove's market orders are DeFi market orders which are different from market orders in TradFi:

In TradFi, a market order is an order to buy or sell immediately at the best available price.

In DeFi, where transactions can be front-run/sandwiched, adversaries may manipulate the best available price and thus extract value from a market order as there is no limit on the price. TradFi market orders are therefore unsafe for fully on-chain DEX'es like Mangrove.

To protect the user, Mangrove's market order therefore corresponds to a **limit order** in TradFi: An order to buy or sell at or below a given price.
More precisely, Mangrove ensures that the **average** price of the offers matched with the order does not exceed the specified price.

:::


When an order is processed by Mangrove's matching engine, it consumes the offers on the selected [offer list](../offer-list.md), starting from the one which as the best [rank](../offer-list.md#offer-rank). Execution works as follows:

1. Mangrove checks that the current offer's [entailed price](../offer-list.md#wants-gives-and-entailed-price) is at least as good as the taker's price. Otherwise execution stops there.
2. Mangrove sends _inbound_ tokens to the current offer's associated [logic](../reactive-offer/maker-contract.md).
3. Mangrove then executes the offer logic.
4. If the call is successful, Mangrove sends _outbound_ tokens to the taker. If the call or the transfer fail, Mangrove reverts the effects of steps 2. and 3.
5. The taker's _wants_ and _gives_ are reduced.
6. If the taker's _wants_ has not been completely fulfilled, Mangrove moves back to step 1.

Any failed [offer](../reactive-offer/) execution results in a [bounty](../reactive-offer/offer-provision.md#computing-the-provision-and-offer-bounty) being sent to the caller as compensation for the wasted gas.

### Inputs

* `outbound_tkn` address of the _outbound_ token (that the taker will buy).
* `inbound_tkn` address of the _inbound_ token (that the taker will spend).
* `takerWants` raw amount of outbound token the taker wants. Must fit on 160 bits.
* `takerGives` raw amount of _inbound_ token the taker gives. Must fit on 160 bits.
* `fillWants`
  * If `true`, the market order will stop as soon as `takerWants` _outbound_ tokens have been bought. It is conceptually similar to a _buy order_.
  * If `false`, the market order will continue until `takerGives` _inbound_ tokens have been spent. It is conceptually similar to _sell order_.
  * Note that market orders can stop for other reasons, such as the price being too high.

### Outputs

* `takerGot` is the net amount of _outbound_ tokens the taker has received (i.e after applying the offer list [fee](../../governance-parameters/local-variables.md#taker-fees) if any).
* `takerGave` is the amount of _inbound_ tokens the taker has sent.
* `bounty` is the amount of native tokens (in units of wei) the taker received in compensation for cleaning failing offers
* `fee` is the amount of `outbound_tkn` that was sent to Mangrove's vault in payment of the potential %%fee|taker-fee%% associated to the `(outbound_tkn, inbound_tkn)`[offer list](../offer-list.md#general-structure).&#x20;

:::tip **Specification**

At the end of a Market Order the following is guaranteed to hold:

* The taker will not spend more than `takerGives`.
* The average price paid `takerGave/(`takerGot + fee`)` will be maximally close to `takerGives/takerWants:`for each offer taken, the amount paid will be $$\leq$$ the expected amount + 1.

:::

| ID | wants (USDC) | gives (DAI) |
| -- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 2  | 0.98         | 1           |
| 1  | 9.9          | 10          |

:::info **Example**

Consider the DAI-USDC offer list (with no fee) above. If a taker calls `marketOrder`on this offer list with`takerWants=2` and `takerGives = 2.2` she is ready to give away up to 2.2 USDC in order to get 2 DAI.

* If `fillWants` is `true` the market order will provide 2 DAI for 1.97 USDC.
  1. 1 DAI for 0.98 USDC from offer #2
  2. 1 DAI for 0.99 from offer #1
* If `fillWants` is `false` the market order will provide 2.2078 DAI for 2 USDC.
  1. 1 DAI for 0.98 USDC from offer #1
  2. 1.2078 DAI for the remaining 1.22 USDC from offer #2

:::

### More on market order behaviour

Mangrove's market orders are configurable using the three parameters `takerWants`, `takerGives` and `fillWants.` Suppose one wants to buy or sell some token `B` (base), using token `Q` (quote) as payment.

* **Market buy:** A limit **buy** order for x tokens B, corresponds to a `marketOrder` on the (`B`,`Q`) offer list with `takerWants=x` (the volume one wishes to buy) and with `takerGives` such that `takerGives/x` is the limit price cap, and setting `fillWants` to `true`.
* **Market sell:** A limit **sell** order for x tokens B, corresponds to a `marketOrder` on the (`Q`, `B`) offer list with `takerGives=x` (the volume one wishes to sell) and with `takerWants` such that `takerGives/x` is the limit price cap, and setting `fillWants` to `false`.

:::caution **On order residuals**

Contrary to [GTC orders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gtc.asp) on regular [order book](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp) based exchanges, the residual of your order (i.e. the volume you were not able to buy/sell due to hitting your price limit) will _not_ be put on the market as an offer. Instead, the market order will simply end partially filled.

:::

### Market order prices are volume-weighted

Consider the following A-B offer list:

| ID | Wants (B) | Gives (A) | Price (B per A) |
| -- | --------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 1  | 1         | 1         | 1               |
| 2  | 2         | 1         | 2               |
| 3  | 6         | 2         | 3               |

A regular limit order with `takerWants` set to 3 A and `takerGives` set to 6 B would consume offers until it hits an offer with a price above 2, so it would consume offers #1 and #2, but not offer #3.

In Mangrove, a "market order" with the same parameters will however consume offers #1 and #2 completely and #3 partially (for 3 Bs only), and result in the taker spending 6 (1+2+6/2) and receiving (1+1+2/2), which corresponds to a volume-weighted price of 2, complying with the Taker Order.

## Offer sniping

It is also possible to target specific offer IDs in the [offer list](../offer-list.md). This is called **Offer Sniping**.

:::info 

Offer sniping can be used by off-chain bots and price aggregators to build their own optimized market order, targeting for instance offers with a higher volume or less gas requirements in order to optimize the gas cost of filling the order.

### Inputs

* `outbound_tkn` _outbound_ token address (received by the taker)
* `inbound_tkn` _inbound_ token address (sent by the taker)
* `targets` an array of offers to take. Each element of `targets` is a `uint[4]`'s of the form `[offerId, takerWants, takerGives, gasreq_permitted]` where:
  * `offerId` is the ID of an [offer](../reactive-offer/) that should be taken.
  * `takerWants` the amount of outbound tokens the taker wants from that [offer](../reactive-offer/). **Must fit in a `uint96`.**
  * `takerGives` the amount of inbound tokens the taker is willing to give to that [offer](../reactive-offer/). **Must fit in a `uint96`.**
  * `gasreq_permitted` is the maximum `gasreq` the taker will tolerate for that [offer](../reactive-offer/). If the offer's `gasreq` is higher than `gasreq_permitted`, the offer will not be sniped.
* `fillWants` specifies whether you are acting as a buyer of **outbound tokens**, in which case you will buy at most `takerWants`, or a seller of **inbound tokens**, in which case you will buy as many tokens as possible as long as you don't spend more than `takerGives`.&#x20;

:::caution **Protection against malicious offer updates**

Offers can be updated, so if `targets` was just an array of `offerId`s, there would be no way to protect against a malicious offer update mined right before a snipe. The offer could suddenly have a worse price, or require a lot more gas.

If you only want to take offers without any checks on the offer contents, you can simply:

* Set `takerWants` to `0`,
* Set `takerGives` to `type(uint96).max`,
* Set `gasreq_permitted` to `type(uint).max`, and
* Set `fillWants` to `false`.

:::

### Outputs

* `successes` is the number of sniped offers that transferred the expected volume to the taker (in particular `successes < target.length` if and only if some of the sniped offers reneged on their trade and `bounty > 0`).
* `takerGot, takerGet, bounty, fee` as in `marketOrder`.

#### Example

| ID | Wants | Gives | Gas required |
| -- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 13 | 10    | 10    | 80\_000      |
| 2  | 1     | 2     | 250\_000     |

:::info **Example**

Consider the above offers on the DAI-USDC offer list:

Setting `targets` to `[[13,8,10,80_000],[2,1,1.1,250_000]]` with `fillWants` set to `true` will successfully buy 8 DAI from offer #13 (for 8 USDC), and will not attempt to execute offer #2 since 1.1 > 1/2.
