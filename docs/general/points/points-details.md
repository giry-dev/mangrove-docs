# Trading & LP Points

## Trading Points

Trading points are awarded to takers on a daily basis, depending on the volume traded by takers and a predetermined weight for each market.

| Market                | Points                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| WETH/USDB             | Every $1 traded equals 1 point |
| mwstETH-PUNKS:20/WETH | Every $1 traded equals 1 point |
| mwstETH-PUNKS:40/WETH | Every $1 traded equals 1 point |

## Liquidity Provision Points
Liquidity Provision points are awarded to makers on a daily basis, depending on the daily trading points and a predetermined weight for each market.

| Market                | Points                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| WETH/USDC             | Makers earn 3 times the points earned by takers. |
| mwstETH-PUNKS:20/WETH | Makers earn 3 times the points earned by takers. |
| mwstETH-PUNKS:40/WETH | Makers earn 3 times the points earned by takers. |
  
The distribution of points among makers isn't purely proportional to the volume generated by their liquidity.
